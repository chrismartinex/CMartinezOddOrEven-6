# CMartinezOddOrEven-6
Relooked at this code, its still a basic and to the point code, 
the only enhancement I did, was add .ToLower() string method, to ensure
that if the user decides to type caps and lowercase, the program will still
intake the informartion of YES or No to replay or end game. 

Peer review by Carlos Felipe: This program is very energetic I like the exclamation marks and capitalized words. I tried breaking the code but to no avail. This code is as inpenetrable as Fort Knox. Data validation and replayability check out and I had a fun time playing. Good job!
